# Nom: Arduino Rhythm Video Game

## Welcome to Nom!
In this game, you control a husky puppy who wants to eat as many pancakes as possible.
Catch the pancakes as they fall from the sky to unlock a "music note". Altogether, 
you will hear the Super Mario Bros theme song!

## Game Features
1. Levels: The more rounds you play, the faster the pancakes fall!
2. Double Point Time: The blue LED will turn on randomly for several seconds. During this time, each pancake is worth double points.
3. Music: A piezo buzzer to convert pancakes eaten into an exciting melody.
4. Haptic feedback: When you miss a pancake, the board buzzes to alert you of the miss.

## Technologies Used
1. Arduino
2. C++ for game loop + logic
3. OOP - Class-based Sprite and Pancake components
4. Custom sprites using bitmaps
5. Physical components: OLED display, Joystick, Piezo Buzzer, and LED components
6. Haptic feedback using vibromotors
